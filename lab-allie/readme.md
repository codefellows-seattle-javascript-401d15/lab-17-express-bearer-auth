## Bearer Auth Lab

This lab uses a Mongo database to allow a user to sign up with a password and email address, then sign back in using the same credentials. This lab also used Mongo to create a Gallery that can be referenced through the user's token. The gallery can be added, fetched, updated, or deleted. A token was generated and can be used to retrieve the information. All of the shell commands utilize HTTPie.

### Users
In the command line, the following command can be used to create a new user through the POST method:

`http POST :3000/api/signup username=<username> email=<email> password=<password>`

The GET method can be used to retrieve the user's entry in Mongo using the following command: 

`http GET :3000/api/signin -a <username>:<password>`

### Galleries
In the command line, the following command can be used to create a new gallery through the POST method:
`http POST :3000/api/gallery  name=<picture name> desc=<description> 'Authorization:Bearer <token retrieved from user with GET method, above>'`

The GET method can be used to retrieve the gallery's entry in Mongo using the following command:
`http GET :3000/api/gallery/<galleryID> 'Authorization:Bearer <token retrieved from user with GET method, above>'`

The PUT method can be used to update the gallery's entry in Mongo using the following command:
`http PUT :3000/api/gallery/<galleryID> name=<new picture name> desc=<new description> 'Authorization:Bearer <token retrieved from user with GET method, above>'`

The DELETE method can be used to remove the gallery's entry in Mongo using the following command:
`http DELETE :3000/api/gallery/<galleryID> 'Authorization:Bearer <token retrieved from user with GET method, above>'`
